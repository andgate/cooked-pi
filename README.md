## cooked-pi

[![build status][build]][travis]

In the spirit of the holidays I baked a type checker for λΠ in several
different styles.

 - As presented in Simple Easy!
 - With [bound][bound]
 - With [unbound][unbound]
 - With HOAS

I [blogged a bit][blog1] about the Simple Easy! bidirectional type
checker. I will eventually blog a bit about the other styles, the
draft is in [jozefg/drafts][draft].

Enjoy!
